Project: Proximity Sensor Design

> Description: 
This is a plug-and-play printed circuit board (PCB) proximity sensor design. It detects metal targets approaching perpendicularly as well as their moving direction. It uses an inductance to digital converter circuit. Machine learning models are used to differentiate between different types of metals (in V2 only). All HW and SW source files are included included. HW includes PCB layout files in KiCad and SW includes firmware for the microcontroller (Atmega328p).
